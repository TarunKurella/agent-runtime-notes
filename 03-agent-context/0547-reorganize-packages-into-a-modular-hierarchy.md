# 0547. Reorganize packages into a modular hierarchy — implementation context

## Open this when

packages/ was flat: 18 packages all sat at packages//, so a package's location said nothing about whether it was core product API, a swappable capability seam, a provider adapter, a product integration, or example/test support. The package README carried a FIXME(package-hierarchy) and scripts/publint-all.ts a TODO(package-inventory) flagging exactly this. Core packages, provider integrations, capability seams, example UI support, and snapshot-only replay support all looked equally foundational. This was not just cosmetic.

## Source decision

Packages are grouped by modular role at a uniform packages/// depth. Group directories are pure containers (no package.json); every package keeps its @deepseek-ai/dsh- name --- this is repo structure and maintenance policy, not package renaming. Same-name nesting for capability families. A family's interface package sits at packages/// (llm/llm, bash/bash, session-persistence/session-persistence), with implementations and consumers as flat siblings.

## Decision status

Historical design. Use it to understand an older pressure or failure; locate the replacing decision before implementing anything.

### Tests and executable evidence

- No test file was tied to this note with enough confidence. Read the note's verification section and search the owning package's `tests/` directory.

## How to read the implementation

1. Start with [`scripts/publint-all.ts`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/47f943859bef60e4160492346772ded9b24f765a/scripts/publint-all.ts) because it has the strongest evidence link to the note.
2. Read public types and entry points before implementation details. Write down the contract in plain language.
3. Follow the named constructs into their callers and tests. Confirm which component can actually enforce the rule.
4. Reconstruct one failure path: cancellation, crash, retry, stale state, partial write, or incompatible provider input—whichever the note is protecting against.
5. Only then map the contract into the current Rust repository. Target paths must come from that repository, never from guesswork in this wiki.

## Rust harness port

**Likely integration point:** read/write/patch filesystem capability.

Preserve the behavior and ownership rule. Do not mechanically translate Cordis, TypeScript declaration merging, Node streams, or package topology into Rust.

Relevant standing rules:

- **`rust/append-log`** — Keep durable facts append-only and derive views from them. Separate the synchronous fact boundary from asynchronous persistence.
- **`rust/capability-security`** — Make granted capabilities explicit. On the Windows no-admin path, probe support at runtime and fail closed rather than silently running unsandboxed.
- **`rust/four-tool-surface`** — Preserve the four model tools: read, write, patch, and exec. Reuse internal capabilities without automatically exposing new model-facing tools.
- **`rust/process-discipline`** — Treat this as repository or release policy unless it changes a runtime contract. Do not add runtime machinery for a process-only lesson.
- **`rust/provider-adapter`** — Keep provider wire quirks inside adapters; the loop and durable event vocabulary remain provider-neutral.
- **`rust/quickjs-boundary`** — QuickJS holds orchestration variables; Rust/Tokio owns async execution and exposes only explicitly granted capabilities.
- **`rust/tokio-cancellation`** — Thread one cancellation token through async work, close owned resources before reuse, and test cancellation at every await boundary.
- **`rust/trait-seam`** — Use a small trait at the capability boundary; keep policy and model-facing schemas outside the backend implementation.
- **Status gate** — Historical design. Use it to understand an older pressure or failure; locate the replacing decision before implementing anything.

### Smallest safe implementation slice

1. Express the semantic contract as Rust types and one owning boundary.
2. Add the smallest adapter or service needed by the existing loop; do not add a new model-facing tool unless the four-tool surface cannot express the job.
3. Record durable evidence before deriving summaries or UI state.
4. Add one happy-path test, one interruption test, and one replay/restart test where state survives a turn.
5. Keep the patch reversible until the source note's strongest failure case is proven in the Rust harness.

## Agent handoff

> Read the raw note, then the strongest implementation paths above at the pinned commit. Inspect the current Rust repository before naming target files. State the pressure, owner, contract, failure schedule, and evidence. Preserve the four model tools (`read`, `write`, `patch`, `exec`), lossless session evidence, Tokio-owned concurrency, explicit QuickJS capabilities, and fail-closed sandboxing. Propose the smallest reversible patch and tests; do not copy a proposed, rejected, or archived mechanism as if it shipped.
