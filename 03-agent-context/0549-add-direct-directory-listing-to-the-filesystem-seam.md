# 0549. Add direct directory listing to the filesystem seam — implementation context

## Open this when

@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs is the provider seam for filesystem access, with local and future non-local backends behind the same ctx.fs contract. Before this change it could resolve paths, stat targets, read text, stream text, write text, and edit text. That was enough for model-facing file tools, but not for non-model-facing consumers that need to enumerate directories without importing node:fs. The immediate pressure came from skill loading: reading an individual SKILL.md can already go through ctx.get('fs'), but discovering which skill roots contain /SKILL.md or .md still needs directory enumeration.

## Source decision

Add FileSystem.listDir(target, signal?) to @deepseek-ai/dsh-fs. listDir lists one directory level only. It returns direct children in stable name order and includes: name: the child basename. type: file, directory, or other. target: the resolved child FsTarget. version: cheap metadata when available. size: regular-file size when available. It never reads file contents. Recursive traversal, globbing, pagination, search, file watching, and model-facing rendering are intentionally out of scope.

## Decision status

Historical design. Use it to understand an older pressure or failure; locate the replacing decision before implementing anything.

## How to read the implementation

1. Start with [`packages/fs/fs/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/47f943859bef60e4160492346772ded9b24f765a/packages/fs/fs/src/index.ts) because it has the strongest evidence link to the note.
2. Read public types and entry points before implementation details. Write down the contract in plain language.
3. Follow the named constructs into their callers and tests. Confirm which component can actually enforce the rule.
4. Reconstruct one failure path: cancellation, crash, retry, stale state, partial write, or incompatible provider input—whichever the note is protecting against.
5. Only then map the contract into the current Rust repository. Target paths must come from that repository, never from guesswork in this wiki.

## Rust harness port

**Likely integration point:** sandbox capability boundary.

Preserve the behavior and ownership rule. Do not mechanically translate Cordis, TypeScript declaration merging, Node streams, or package topology into Rust.

Relevant standing rules:

- **`rust/capability-security`** — Make granted capabilities explicit. On the Windows no-admin path, probe support at runtime and fail closed rather than silently running unsandboxed.
- **`rust/four-tool-surface`** — Preserve the four model tools: read, write, patch, and exec. Reuse internal capabilities without automatically exposing new model-facing tools.
- **`rust/newtype-ids`** — Represent identity domains with Rust newtypes; do not pass bare strings across session, call, turn, step, and agent boundaries.
- **`rust/provider-adapter`** — Keep provider wire quirks inside adapters; the loop and durable event vocabulary remain provider-neutral.
- **`rust/quickjs-boundary`** — QuickJS holds orchestration variables; Rust/Tokio owns async execution and exposes only explicitly granted capabilities.
- **`rust/serde-validation`** — Parse untrusted input into strict serde types and validate semantic constraints before executing side effects.
- **`rust/tagged-enums`** — Use serde-tagged enums for a closed wire vocabulary. Add an explicit extension envelope only where runtime extension is truly required.
- **`rust/tokio-cancellation`** — Thread one cancellation token through async work, close owned resources before reuse, and test cancellation at every await boundary.
- **`rust/trait-seam`** — Use a small trait at the capability boundary; keep policy and model-facing schemas outside the backend implementation.
- **Status gate** — Historical design. Use it to understand an older pressure or failure; locate the replacing decision before implementing anything.

### Smallest safe implementation slice

1. Express the semantic contract as Rust types and one owning boundary.
2. Add the smallest adapter or service needed by the existing loop; do not add a new model-facing tool unless the four-tool surface cannot express the job.
3. Record durable evidence before deriving summaries or UI state.
4. Add one happy-path test, one interruption test, and one replay/restart test where state survives a turn.
5. Keep the patch reversible until the source note's strongest failure case is proven in the Rust harness.

## Agent handoff

> Read the raw note, then the strongest implementation paths above at the pinned commit. Inspect the current Rust repository before naming target files. State the pressure, owner, contract, failure schedule, and evidence. Preserve the four model tools (`read`, `write`, `patch`, `exec`), lossless session evidence, Tokio-owned concurrency, explicit QuickJS capabilities, and fail-closed sandboxing. Propose the smallest reversible patch and tests; do not copy a proposed, rejected, or archived mechanism as if it shipped.
