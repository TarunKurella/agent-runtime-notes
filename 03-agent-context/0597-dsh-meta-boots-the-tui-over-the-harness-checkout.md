# 0597. `dsh meta` boots the TUI over the harness checkout — implementation context

## Open this when

dsh treats the invoking directory as the workspace, which is what makes it useful on arbitrary projects. Working on dsh itself therefore means cd-ing to the checkout first --- and the checkout is not a memorable path: the source install keeps it under a container directory as a timestamped staging worktree (~/.dsh/source/staging-) behind a current symlink, so the target moves on every upgrade. The agent is already told where its source lives by the harness:source prompt section, and the cordis toolset can modify that runtime, but the human still had to locate the directory by hand to start a session there.

## Source decision

dsh meta boots the ordinary TUI with the harness checkout as the workspace, from any directory. The target is SOURCE_ROOT in apps/cli/src/tui.ts --- fileURLToPath(new URL('../../..', import.meta.url)), three hops up from apps/cli/{src,lib} --- the same constant the harness:source prompt section already names, so the workspace and the path advertised to the model cannot drift. It follows the launcher's real path, so a PATH symlink through current resolves to whichever staging worktree is active.

## Decision status

Historical design. Use it to understand an older pressure or failure; locate the replacing decision before implementing anything.

- Source verification intent: apps/cli/tests/args.spec.ts pins routing for meta, rejection of every leaked default-surface option, and rejection of the former experimental-meta name. The dispatch itself is composition inside bin.ts's existing v8 ignore block. There is no keyless PTY smoke for this mode. The smoke harness gives each run a temp cwd, but dsh meta deliberately chdirs to the real checkout, so a smoke would write .sessions/ into the live tree mid-test. Covering it properly needs an injectable target directory --- a test-only seam this note declines to add for a one-line chdir. The mode was verified interactively instead.

## How to read the implementation

1. Start with [`apps/cli/src/args.ts`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/47f943859bef60e4160492346772ded9b24f765a/apps/cli/src/args.ts) because it has the strongest evidence link to the note.
2. Read public types and entry points before implementation details. Write down the contract in plain language.
3. Follow the named constructs into their callers and tests. Confirm which component can actually enforce the rule.
4. Reconstruct one failure path: cancellation, crash, retry, stale state, partial write, or incompatible provider input—whichever the note is protecting against.
5. Only then map the contract into the current Rust repository. Target paths must come from that repository, never from guesswork in this wiki.

## Rust harness port

**Likely integration point:** read/write/patch filesystem capability.

Preserve the behavior and ownership rule. Do not mechanically translate Cordis, TypeScript declaration merging, Node streams, or package topology into Rust.

Relevant standing rules:

- **`rust/append-log`** — Keep durable facts append-only and derive views from them. Separate the synchronous fact boundary from asynchronous persistence.
- **`rust/capability-security`** — Make granted capabilities explicit. On the Windows no-admin path, probe support at runtime and fail closed rather than silently running unsandboxed.
- **`rust/four-tool-surface`** — Preserve the four model tools: read, write, patch, and exec. Reuse internal capabilities without automatically exposing new model-facing tools.
- **`rust/provider-adapter`** — Keep provider wire quirks inside adapters; the loop and durable event vocabulary remain provider-neutral.
- **`rust/quickjs-boundary`** — QuickJS holds orchestration variables; Rust/Tokio owns async execution and exposes only explicitly granted capabilities.
- **`rust/tokio-cancellation`** — Thread one cancellation token through async work, close owned resources before reuse, and test cancellation at every await boundary.
- **`rust/trait-seam`** — Use a small trait at the capability boundary; keep policy and model-facing schemas outside the backend implementation.
- **Status gate** — Historical design. Use it to understand an older pressure or failure; locate the replacing decision before implementing anything.

### Smallest safe implementation slice

1. Express the semantic contract as Rust types and one owning boundary.
2. Add the smallest adapter or service needed by the existing loop; do not add a new model-facing tool unless the four-tool surface cannot express the job.
3. Record durable evidence before deriving summaries or UI state.
4. Add one happy-path test, one interruption test, and one replay/restart test where state survives a turn.
5. Keep the patch reversible until the source note's strongest failure case is proven in the Rust harness.

## Agent handoff

> Read the raw note, then the strongest implementation paths above at the pinned commit. Inspect the current Rust repository before naming target files. State the pressure, owner, contract, failure schedule, and evidence. Preserve the four model tools (`read`, `write`, `patch`, `exec`), lossless session evidence, Tokio-owned concurrency, explicit QuickJS capabilities, and fail-closed sandboxing. Propose the smallest reversible patch and tests; do not copy a proposed, rejected, or archived mechanism as if it shipped.
